# GifTastic

**GifTastic uses the Giphy API to display fun pet giphys! The user can click on the buttons on the top of the screen to see the static giphy images. If the user clicks on the image, the giphys will animate. There is a form in which the user can search for giphys that will then be added a button. The user can view these giphys and animate them once clicked.**

*GifTastic uses an AJAX call to GET data from the giphy API. In addition, this project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery.*
